## 👋 Hi, I’m Mukul Goyal  

I build and scale **technology-enabled business systems** at the intersection of **growth, execution, and platforms**.

My work focuses on turning ideas into **structured, scalable systems** — combining **business strategy, data, cloud, and AI** to solve real-world problems and create long-term value.

This GitHub is **not a traditional developer portfolio**.  
It is a **thinking + execution portfolio** that documents how I design systems, frameworks, and solutions that scale.
